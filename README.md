###Okay lets get a few things started. This may require dependencies that are not obtainable


**Requirements**:
1. If you use an external instance you are required to use the following JAR:
    - <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.3_1232>
2. You need to ensure your application.yaml is up to date and has the same settings as <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Red-DiscordBot/blob/V3/edge/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>



**NOTES - READ ME**

I'm expecting things to be broken, if you are using this at the very least report issues, otherwise if I get people using this without reporting I'll just simply revoke any entries of this.

Required the following PR's:

1. https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/4062 - Otherwise Menus will not work.
2. https://github.com/Drapersniper/Red-Lavalink/tree/edge - Otherwise RLL will not be able to start up as Audio assumes the new stuff from it exists + it is using the pre-release JAR.
