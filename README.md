# Requirements:
1. If you use an external instance you are required to use the following JAR:
    - <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Lavalink-Jars/releases/latest>
2. You need to ensure your application.yaml is up to date and has the same settings as <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Audio/blob/master/audio/data/application.yml>



## NOTES

I'll be maintaining in independently of Red, none of this work will be contributed into Red due to disagreement with the lead core dev in that project and his toxicity, however you are more than free to use this cog instead of the bundled Audio cog and make suggestion and feature requests here, just be aware that by doing, so it will likely make a move back to core Audio unsafe, due to potential config migration in here.
