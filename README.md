#**Requirements**:
1. If you use an external instance you are required to use the following JAR:
    - <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Lavalink-Jars/releases/latest>
2. You need to ensure your application.yaml is up to date and has the same settings as <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Audio/blob/master/audio/data/application.yml>



##**NOTES - READ ME**

I'm expecting things to be broken, if you are using this at the very least report issues, otherwise if I get people using this without reporting I'll just simply revoke any entries of this.
