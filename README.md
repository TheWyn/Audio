###Okay lets get a few things started. This may require dependencies that are not obtainable


**Requirements**:
1. RLL 0.9.1 (Run `pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/Drapersniper/Red-Lavalink.git@edge#egg=Red-Lavalink` in your venv before installing the cog.)
2. If you use an external instance you are required to use the following JAR:
    - <https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Lavalink-Jars/releases/tag/3.3.2.3_1232>
3. You need to ensure your application.yaml is up to date and has the same settings as <https://github.com/Drapersniper/Red-DiscordBot/blob/V3/edge/redbot/cogs/audio/data/application.yml>



**NOTES - READ ME**

I'm expecting things to be broken, if you are using this at the very least report issues, otherwise if I get people using this without reporting I'll just simply revoke any entries of this.
